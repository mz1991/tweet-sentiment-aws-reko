# Tweet sentiment analysis with Amazon Rekognition.

The code in this repository allows you to perform a sentiment analysis task againts the media (pictures) of some Tweets.
The medias are analyzed using the Amazon Rekognition service.
To download the media I have been using the Streaming API.

Feel free to fork the project or pull new requests.
In particular would be cool to improve or add the following:
- for each Tweet compare the sentiment of the image with the sentiment of the text (is there a correlation? how strong?)
- build a front-end to see the downloaded images and the results of the sentiment analysis
